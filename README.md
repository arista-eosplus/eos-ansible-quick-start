# Ansible + Arista Quick Start
A simple Ansible setup to get you up and running faster!

## Intro
This repo includes automated playbooks that will help you run some basic playbooks against your Arista EOS switch. This setup is not meant to be a boilerplate for production, rather, a quick and easy way to learn the basics.

## Prereqs
* git
* Ansible 2.1+ (or Ansible 2.0.1 networking preview [releases](http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-network/latest))
* A CLI user created on your switch
* An Arista EOS switch with eAPI enabled or SSH access
